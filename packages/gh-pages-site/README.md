# An example app structure

This will mostly be used internally so we can put up examples of some components, but in it's current state, it's a good showcase for an example app structure using the components mentioned in the wiki.

There's some more real-world uses of things like the `createTheme` function in `design-system/shared-frontend` as well as (still limited) usage of the app-shell and other usages.

Some of these features aren't yet in the `main` branch, but if you read the wiki, those features will be apparent.
