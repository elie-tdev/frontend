Shared modules for frontend development, including hooks, helpers, components.

## Packages

- [`design-system/shared-frontend`](./packages/shared-frontend/README.md) Overridable MUI theme configuration that implements the default conventions of the  Design System.
- [`design-system/pattern-sidebar-navigation`](./packages/pattern-sidebar-navigation/README.md) Opinionated sidebar navigation component that implements the  Design System's sidebar navigation pattern. Runs completely autonomously at the top of an application, to easily simplify navigation of large and small apps alike.
- [`design-system/pattern-app-shell`](./packages/pattern-app-shell/README.md) A high-level abstraction that provides a navigation-sidebar, right-sidebar, and header abstraction as a single package. It has been designed and developed by the BAI XD team to serve as an example, and in many cases, a useable component OOTB for many teams.
